# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.2-beta.3] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- Improved tariff source selection to support three paths in priority order: GraphQL HCC tariff, web reimbursement tariff, then web rounded tariff.
- Added tariff source diagnostics attributes so it is visible which source is currently used and what raw/parsed web tariff values are available.
- Hardened session cost calculations to parse locale-formatted numeric strings from both GraphQL and web status payloads.

## [1.2.2-beta.2] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed
- Added tariff fallback from dashboard data (`TARIFF`, for example `0,36 EUR`) when GraphQL HCC tariff is unavailable or disabled.
- Improved locale number parsing to handle currency-suffixed tariff strings.
- Hardened GraphQL response parsing for `data: null` responses to avoid `NoneType` errors in VAT/transaction fallback logic.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- Guard coordinator fallback paths when `self.data` is not initialized yet to prevent `NoneType` membership errors during setup.
- Harden customer lookup parsing when API returns empty nested lists to prevent `list index out of range` warnings.
- Make spot polling and device info retrieval safe when coordinator data is temporarily unavailable.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **Refresh status**: The Refresh Status button and `evcnet.refresh_status` service now call the portal GetStatus API before refreshing data; previously they only triggered a coordinator refresh and did not request fresh status from the charger.
- Action services (refresh_status, soft_reset, hard_reset, etc.) are now registered with proper async handlers so the service calls are correctly awaited (fixes "coroutine was never awaited" warning in logs).

### Changed
- Refresh Status button now uses the same base class and execution flow as the other action buttons (API call, settle delay, coordinator refresh).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-12

This release introduces multi-channel support and is versioned 1.0.0 to reflect the impact for users with multi-connector charging stations.

🙏 A big shout-out to @nikagl for creating the multi-channel support, log retrieval, refresh status and stop charging features.

### Added
- **Log retrieval**: New sensors show charging log summary, last log time, and last log notification. The log summary sensor exposes a markdown table of recent sessions (usable in a Markdown card).
- **Multi-channel support**: For charging stations with multiple connectors, you can set "Max channels" in the integration options to get per-channel sensors and switches (e.g. "Ch 1 Charging", "Ch 2 Charging"). Single-connector setups are unchanged.
- **Refresh status**: New button and `evcnet.refresh_status` action to trigger an immediate status update from the portal.
- **Stop charging**: New `evcnet.stop_charging` action to stop the current charging session via an automation or script.

### Changed
- Session energy sensor now uses the correct state class for cumulative energy (total_increasing).
- Log data (entries, table, markdown) is attached to the log summary sensor and is not stored in history, avoiding Recorder warnings while keeping the data available for the UI.
- Improved login handling (browser-like headers, retry limit and backoff) for more reliable authentication across different EVC-net endpoints.
- Reduced logging noise: only useful messages at normal level; technical details moved to debug.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-12-10

### Fixed

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-13
